This change adds a catch-all rewrite rule `"source": "/(.*)"` that redirects all routes to `/`, which serves your `index.html`. This allows React Router to intercept the routes and handle them on the client side. The Sanity studio routes are matched first, so they won't be affected by this catch-all rule.
